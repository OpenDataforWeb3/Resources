# Anti-Sybil and Anti-Centralization DataBuilders Hackathon kicks off 2023

*Fight Sybils, Decentralize Data*
January 4, 2023

Happy New Year everyone!

We are extremely excited to announce that January 5th - aka *tomorrow* - we will kick off our second hackathon. This one we are calling the DataBuilder Hackathon. Read on to learn a little more about the competition and why we are so excited to be kicking off 2023 with a broadly supported and, we think, innovative hackathon.  

Contestants will compete - and collaborate - to find insightful anti-Sybil algorithms and to package anti-Sybil algorithms into composable Legos. Contestants that use decentralized technologies including those highlighted on the OpenData Community [landscape](https://opendataforweb3.github.io/docs/landscape/) will be preferred. Bounties are also available for contributions to FAQs and other materials. 

In other words -> in addition to rewarding data scientists and analysts for helping to protect public goods funding, we are also rewarding the use of decentralized approaches AND contributions to resources that can help others in the OpenData Community. The idea is to reflect our values in the work that we do. If we all work together to build communities and reinforce decentralization then we can sure up our open and decentralized foundations.

Community members and judges will be discussing the hackathon on a Twitter Space early pacific time on January 5th:

*Protecting Public Goods Funding and Data Decentralization*

DataBuilders contestants will be provided with data from the recent Unicef / Gitcoin and Fantom / Gitcoin public goods funding rounds. Gitcoin helped to found the OpenData Community in part to ensure that as Gitcoin decentralizes - it also decentralizes its expertise in defending public goods funding from Sybil attacks.  

A huge thank you to all of those that have come together to organize, promote, and fund the DataBuilders hackathon.  These organizations include our founding supporter Gitcoin, Ocean Protocol, Pocket Network, Supermodular, TrueBlocks, and a former OpenData Community hackathon winner, TrustaLabs. 

It has been awesome to get to know these organizations better  as we start to work together on this hackathon.  We've co-authored some guides and FAQs that you can find by looking around our very new website and our community resources. Morever we've gotten to know a little bit about how larger organizations work to stay mission aligned while operating efficiently; a special shout out to the DAO at Pocket Network and to our collaborators in the Ocean Protocol. *And of course none of this would be possible without the vision and mentoring of many inside the Gitcoin DAO including the data scientists and analysis and data operators in FDD!*   

Again - the DataBuilders hackathon runs from January 5th through January 31st, 2023. Please register and learn more about the hackathon here (bounties will be added January 5th) at: [https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/DataBuilders/onboard](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/DataBuilders/onboard)
