## What is the ODC?
There are two main aspects to this today:

- Sybil resistance via data science and other approaches
- Resisting recentralization at the data layer

IMO resisting recentralization or supporting decentralized data layer solutions is our bedrock - however without #1 there might not be a locus of effort to rally.

Also we are primarily supported today by Gitcoin which is at the forefront of efforts to resist Sybil attacks both via software via Passport and of course via the efforts of the FDD team within Gitcoin. If we collectively do not resist Sybil attacks then one of the real bright spots of web3 - the collective funding of public goods - would be captured by essentially criminal forces.

We want to highlight values such as:

- openness - working in public and actively requesting input
- candor - being direct and facts based
- inclusive - making a particular effort to welcome and invite a breadth of perspectives
- initiative - last but definitely not least IMO. Perhaps we should emphasize the importance of taking initiative
