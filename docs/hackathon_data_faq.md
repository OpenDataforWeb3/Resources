# ODC's Role in Addressing Sybil and Fraud: Collecting and Curating Strategic Datasets

One responsibility that the ODC has taken on for the broader anti-Sybil and anti-Fraud community is to collect addresses that are very likely to be either Sybils or non-Sybils. We have inherited the nomenclature of the FDD from Gitcoin, which initially collected many of these wallets and collected them into Sybil "Loki" and non-Sybil "Thor" datasets. Due to the sensitivity of these datasets, we restrict access to those that are actively participating in Hackathons or otherwise active in the OpenData Community. The ODC has published our plans on how to curate and improve these strategic datasets on our [Forum](https://forum.opendatacommunity.org/t/an-ongoing-responsibility-the-collection-of-sybil-and-non-sybil-lists/42).

Please get in touch to donate or help to gather valuable datasets or to provide feedback or assistance.  

You need to hit the drop-down list at the top and select the Mumbai network to see the data assets. This makes all the claims free.

For hackathon participants, you will also need to have shared with us your wallet ID via the Buidlbox site in order to be added to the whitelist. Or just DM epowell101 on our Discord.   

When in doubt, take a look at [odc.oceanprotocol.com](https://odc.oceanprotocol.com/) or at the IPFS files also below. Also, please drop into the hackathon support channel and ask around. As of May 2nd, 2023, for example, multiple participants are sharing datasets and collaborating in other ways.

# ODC Datasets

This page lists many datasets available for OpenData Community (ODC) Hackathons! This collection of datasets is made up of old and new data to start off work on Hackathon bounties or Lego development. As a data analyst and scientist you may also wish to develop your own sources of data including via the use of ODC supported projects such as TrueBlocks and Data Dex.  

You may want to use [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) for datasets hosted on the Ocean Protocol.
