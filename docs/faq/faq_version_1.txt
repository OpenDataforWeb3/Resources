##  What is Sybil Attacks and why we should fight it?

The name Sybil originated from a medical case of a woman called Sybil, she was diagnosed  with multiple personality disorder. 
Sybil attack is a kind of "fraud" that occurs on systems/organizations where actions and rewards are calculated based on "one human, one identity", fraudsters or 'sybils' create multiple identities in an attempt to control (vote) or profit ( distributions of funds or rewards).
Fighting this kind of practice enables organizations to have democratic practices without the physical presence of its participants , for example online voting in DAOs.

Nice, now that you understood, is easy to get why fraudster create multiple accounts. The idea is simple, make really small contributions to their own project from different accounts in a attempt to maximize ROI, as quadratic funding algorithm prioritize distribution of matching funds pool to projects that received donations from the biggest number of community members. 

## What is price of forgery? 
Price (or cost) of forgery, as it says, is the cost paid to forge an identity in a system. There are a lot of discussions about economic games involved in sybil defense. Most systems are designed to develop a high cost of forgery in an attempt to disincentivize sybils attacks, making the attack expensive and not profitable. Some discussion argue that this could stop sybil attacks focused on profit but if the motivation is other, like ideological, cost could be not a barrier.  

In ep 36 of Green Pill podcast, Kevin Owocki and Petr Porobov, founder of Upala, have some discussion around the topic and how Upala is trying to understand the real price of forgery using incentives.
