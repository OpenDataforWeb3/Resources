4. [An Anti-Sybil Dashboard for Round Health](https://gitcoin.co/issue/29674) The solution will be Legos Dashboard posted via the Ocean Protocol as an NFT

ODC will permanently publish the records of the Jan 2023 Hackathon and the resulting submissions and bounty winners via the [ODCDataforWeb3/Jan2023hackathon repository](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Jan2023hackathon) 

README in the repository explains the history of the hackathon, an overview of the bounties, and the results. 

**Update https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/DataBuilders/? Gitcoin Databuilders Hackathon page with the same content as the README and links back to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository.**

**We need to collaborate with Gitcoin FDD on above changes to the Gitcoin DataBuilders hackathon page.**

Update the OpenDataCommunity.org hackathon menu to link to a local page that highlights the latest hackathon with a link to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository, future event / hackathon plans, and past hackathons. 

## Reach out to a few people and sponsors that can help the ODC immediately

Bounty 1-4 contributors are new potential ODC Jedi members that can help build the community. We can find them work at one of the sponsors and ask that they continue to contribute to future hackathons, projects, and ODC administration. 

Bounty 2-4 contributors may want to continue their work on algorithms, data analysis, and or dashboard as an ODC project.

## Plan for project maturity

Right now we have 6 groups of people:
- public
- hackathon contributors
- ODC discord members
- ODC Github contributors
- ODC Jedi
- Sponsors

Tiers of ODC membership and project maturity:
- membership: We can continue to establish ODC discord membership as the baseline for being a "ODC member"
- project: practice the basics of team and software development

Let's stop here and wait to define future tiers until we can discuss ideas with sponsors.

## Help the contributors with next steps, Providing ODC sandbox and a bit of tooling

- We provide ODC administrative help to members on how to operate a project
- We create the ODC Sandbox github organization.
- We provide an easy instructions how to create a repository for their work and team. 
- We provide access to tools 
  -  Project: Linear, Dework, Github Project, and / or Jira?
  -  Repository: Github
  -  IDE: Visual Studio Code, Github online, and / or HackMD?
  -  CICD: Github Actions
  -  Landscape tools: TBD as we figure out partners and / or sponsors 
-  and recommended ways of using them.

## Regional and or local infrastructure to help with latency

Maybe this is a stretch goal in the early stages of ODC. Publishing a few stretch goals might help get few more sponsors or contributors that want to work towards them. 

We find sponsors and funding to help ODC projects with compute, network, and storage hardware that can improve their ability to operate within their local area. 

Options are: 
- a fanless local compute to run a node off the contributors local internet service provider
- a regional cloud service provider that can provide discounted or subsidized infrastructure for running a node
- a regional internet service provider that can provide discounted or subsidized network for running a node
