# Overview

This is an overview of the ODC voting process for community specific bounties. The first section details the main steps for ODC members submitting votes with the January 2023 Hackathon as a prime example while the second section offers insight into the Quadratic Voting setup required. 

# Commuity Voting

There are 2 main steps involved in submitting your vote for Hackathon submissions. Highlighting this process with the January 2023 Hackathon:

### 1. Review of all submissions

In the case of the January 2023 Hackathon, the ODC Jedi and the most active community members and  will be voting on submissions for the "Hacking the Hackathon" Bounty (feel free to join in and vote for other bounties but please let `epowell101` know). Please review all submissions using the [Results Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cwB3Jlsuo6Rd18CNIevSpDM8cG2VohWPuKRE_IV59Og/edit?usp=sharing). Clone the sheet and add comments to your version so you can detail thoughts on the different criteria list for the bounty.

### 2. Submission of your votes

As you've decided to vote, please reach out to `epowell101` via DM to ensure you review a unique URL for the Quadratic Voting process. Please ensure that you submit your vote before the end of this week. 

# Quadratic Voting process

Through the efforts of the ODC, here are the basic steps for the process of Quadratic Voting within the community at this time. Appreciation and thanks to curiousrabbit for support on clarifying the process.

### **Step 1**:
Discuss and confirm the different voting groups based on weighting. As an example:
- ODC Jedi: 100 voting power
- ODC member: 30 voting power
- Hackathon Sponsor: 200 voting power

This is just an example and can be changed to fit different group numbers and voting power options.

### **Step 2**:
Set up multiple voting events on [https://quadraticvote.co/](https://quadraticvote.co/) for each voting group per Bounty. To explain, if there are 3 different voting groups with different voting power then we would create 3 different events per Bounty. 

The reason being that each event allows us to set a number of voters with the same voting power. Therefore, there would need to be different events for groups with different voting power.

### **Step 3**:
When setting up each event, ensure that they include:
- Event Title
- Event Description
- Number of voters
- Vote credits per voter
- Start date
- End date

There is an additonal field called options that can be set for each event. Options are the different submissions for that bounty, so there will be alot of copy pasting required during set up. For example, if a bounty has 10 submissions and there are 3 different voting groups, the set up would involve creating 3 events for that bounty. Each event would need to have the  event details filled out and as well as all of the submissions included in the options section.

### **Step 4**: 
Once the event creation step is complete, please make sure to save the private URL for the Event and download the voting links as TXTs. These are the unique URLs to be shareed with voters. Voters should be able to use thier link to go directly to the event, check out the submissions made to a Bounty, and submit votes using the number of voting credits assigned to them.

All these votes can then be download for the final analysis once the process is complete.

### **Step 5**:
The final step in this process involves aggregating the results across all the events made for the same bounty in order to get the weighted results and find our winners!
